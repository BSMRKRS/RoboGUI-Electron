## Cameras

## Post_to_web:

- Use post_to_web.py to send data to GUI from your robot
  - For reference to post_to_web refer to [robo-html](https://github.com/BSMRKRS/robo-html)
- Download post_to_web.py to robot or laptop
  - Post_to_web.py is located in the "Python" sub folder
  - Note: The version of post_to_web in this repo differs from the version in robo-html on line 18. Both versions work, but variables will be displayed as `variable=value` w/ robo-html instead of `variable: value` w/ the version in this repo.

```
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BSMRKRS/RoboGUI-Electron/master/Python/post_to_web.py
```

Example of post_to_web:
```python
# Post_to_web example
# PTW.state['<variable name>'] = <variable value>
import post_to_web as PTW

x = 0

while 1:
    PTW.state['a'] = x
    PTW.state['b'] = x
    PTW.state['c'] = x
    PTW.post()
    x = x + 1
```
